    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a key benefit of using AI to generate unit tests for domain models?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Tests never need to be reviewed" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Accelerates creation of comprehensive test coverage including edge cases" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Eliminates the need for manual testing" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Guarantees 100% code coverage" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "AI can quickly generate comprehensive test suites covering happy paths, edge cases, business rule enforcement, and state transitions. However, you must still review for domain accuracy and add missing domain-specific scenarios."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Test data builders generated by AI should use realistic domain data rather than generic placeholder values.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Realistic test data helps catch edge cases and makes tests more meaningful. AI can generate realistic customer names, product descriptions, prices, and addresses that better represent production scenarios."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is property-based testing used for in DDD systems?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Testing CSS properties" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Verifying that invariants hold for any valid input" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Testing object property assignments" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Testing database indexes" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Property-based testing verifies that domain invariants (like 'total equals sum of items') hold for any valid random input. AI can help generate property tests that test aggregate invariants, state machine properties, and calculation correctness."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When AI reviews code for DDD anti-patterns, what should it check for?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Only syntax errors" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Anemic domain models, missing encapsulation, weak typing, and no domain events" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Only performance issues" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Only formatting problems" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "AI code review should check for DDD anti-patterns like anemic domain models (no behavior), public mutable properties, primitive obsession, missing validation, no invariant protection, and absence of domain events for state changes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "AI-generated tests should verify behavior and business rules, not just implementation details.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Good tests focus on what the code does (behavior), not how it does it (implementation). Tests should verify business rules are enforced, state transitions are valid, and invariants are maintained, not internal method calls."
