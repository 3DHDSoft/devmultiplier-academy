  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is AI particularly effective at in DDD/CQRS development?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Making domain modeling decisions" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Generating boilerplate code for entities, value objects, and repositories" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Talking to domain experts" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Defining aggregate boundaries" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "AI excels at generating repetitive pattern implementations like entities, value objects, repositories, commands, and queries. It struggles with domain understanding, business decisions, and aggregate boundary definition."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "When using AI to generate DDD code, you should always review the generated business rules for domain accuracy.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "AI cannot understand your specific business domain. You must always review AI-generated code for business rule accuracy, validate invariants, ensure domain language is correct, and confirm events include necessary data."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a common pitfall of AI-generated DDD code?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Code is too short" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Over-generic implementations that miss domain-specific business rules" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Too many comments" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Code runs too fast" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "AI often generates overly generic code that lacks domain-specific validation, business rules, and state transition logic. You must refine the code to include specific business constraints from your domain."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "AI can effectively replace domain experts when modeling business requirements.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "AI cannot replace domain experts. It cannot understand your specific business context, talk to stakeholders, or make strategic decisions about the domain. Humans must gather requirements and validate that AI-generated code aligns with business needs."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What should be included in an effective prompt for AI to generate DDD entities?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Only the entity name" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Properties, business rules, domain events, and implementation requirements" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Just the database schema" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "A simple description like 'make an Order class'" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Effective prompts should include properties, business rules, domain events to raise, implementation requirements (validation, factory methods, invariant protection), and technology constraints (TypeScript, strict typing)."
