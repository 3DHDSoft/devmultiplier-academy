    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is Ubiquitous Language in DDD?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "A programming language used by all team members" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "A shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts that permeates code, documentation, and conversations" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "The official language used in company documentation" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "A translation layer between different microservices" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Ubiquitous Language is the shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts that permeates code, documentation, and conversations. When done right, it eliminates translation errors and makes your codebase readable to business stakeholders."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Language mismatch between developers and domain experts is a common source of bugs in software systems.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Language mismatch leads to translation errors. For example, a developer might use 'complete' when the business means 'confirmed', causing bugs where payment is received but bookings aren't properly confirmed."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In the lesson's example, what was the bug caused by language mismatch?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Payments were processed twice" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Reservations were cancelled incorrectly" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Payment was received but booking was not confirmed because developer used 'complete' instead of 'confirmed'" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Database schema was inconsistent" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "The bug occurred because the developer used 'complete' when the business expert meant 'confirmed'. This language mismatch resulted in payments being received but bookings not being properly confirmed."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which approach demonstrates proper use of Ubiquitous Language?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Using generic method names like 'process()' and 'handle()'" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Having a 'BookingService' with methods like 'completeBooking()' and 'confirmBooking()' with unclear distinctions" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Using domain terms like 'Reservation.confirmPayment()' that match how business experts describe the operation" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Adding comments to explain what business terms map to technical terms" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Proper Ubiquitous Language means code uses the exact same terms as domain experts. 'Reservation.confirmPayment()' directly maps to the business statement 'A Reservation is confirmed when Payment is received.'"
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "It's acceptable to use different terms in code than in business conversations as long as there's documentation mapping them.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "DDD emphasizes that the same terms should be used everywhere - in code, documentation, and conversations. Translation layers and mapping documentation lead to miscommunication and bugs. The language should be truly ubiquitous."
