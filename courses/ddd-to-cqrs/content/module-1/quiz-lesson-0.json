    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Claude excels at DDD/CQRS because it can analyze entire bounded contexts at once due to its long context capability.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Claude's long context window allows it to analyze entire bounded contexts simultaneously. Combined with deep reasoning and agentic capabilities, it can plan and execute multi-step refactorings autonomously."
