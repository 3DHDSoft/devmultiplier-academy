        { "id": "d", "text": "A testing approach for event handlers" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Event Storming is a collaborative workshop technique where domain experts and developers map out business processes using sticky notes. It's used at the beginning of projects, when exploring new features, or when the existing model feels wrong."

      "question": "What color sticky note represents Domain Events in Event Storming?",

        { "id": "a", "text": "Blue" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Yellow" },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Green" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "In Event Storming, orange sticky notes represent Domain Events (things that happened in the past, written in past tense like 'OrderPlaced'). Blue notes are for Commands, and yellow notes are for Aggregates."

      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "An intention to do something, usually triggered by a user" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Something that happened in the past that domain experts care about" },

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A Domain Event is something that happened in the past that domain experts care about. Examples include 'OrderPlaced', 'PaymentReceived', 'OrderShipped'. They are written in past tense."

      "question": "Commands in Event Storming are written in imperative form, like 'PlaceOrder' or 'ProcessPayment'.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Commands represent an intention to do something and are written in imperative form (PlaceOrder, ProcessPayment, ShipOrder). This contrasts with Domain Events which are past tense (OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived)."
