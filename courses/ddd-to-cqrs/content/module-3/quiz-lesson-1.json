    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What primarily defines an entity in DDD?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Its attributes and properties" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Its unique identity that persists throughout its lifecycle" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Its methods and behaviors" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Its relationship to other objects" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "An entity is defined by its identity rather than its attributes. Even as its attributes change, the entity remains the same entity as long as the identity is preserved."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Two entities with the same attributes but different IDs should be considered equal.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Entities are equal only if they have the same ID, regardless of their attributes. This is the opposite of value objects, which are equal when their attributes are equal."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which identity generation strategy is best for distributed systems?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Database auto-increment" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "UUID/GUID" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Sequential integers" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Composite keys only" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "UUIDs can be generated without a database round-trip, work in distributed systems, and can be generated on the client-side with no collision risk."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of a private constructor with static factory methods in entities?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To improve performance" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "To enforce creation rules and differentiate between new creation and reconstitution" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "To reduce code duplication" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "To support dependency injection" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Private constructors with factory methods like create() for new entities and reconstitute() for database loading enforce proper validation and allow different creation paths for new vs. persisted entities."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Entities can have their attributes modified over time while maintaining the same identity.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Unlike value objects which are immutable, entities are mutable. A customer can change their email, name, or address while remaining the same customer with the same ID."
