>
> "You've built features. You've shipped products. But somewhere along the way, your codebase became... complicated."
>
> **[SLIGHT PAUSE - knowing look]**
>
> "Business logic scattered across service layers. Changes that should take hours taking days. Domain experts and developers speaking different languages."
>
> **[LEAN IN - direct eye contact]**
>
> "I've been there. And that's exactly why I created this course."
>
> "Welcome to 'From DDD to CQRS with AI Agents.' I'm Ivan Farkas, and over the next several hours, I'm going to show you how to tame complexity in your software systems."

### Script

> **[PRESENTER + ROADMAP ANIMATION]**
>
> "Here's what we're covering."

> "We start with Domain-Driven Design fundamentals. You'll learn to speak the same language as your business stakeholders and model domains that actually make sense."
>
> **[ANIMATION: Module 2-3 nodes appear, connected]**
>
> "Then we go deeper—Bounded Contexts for dividing large systems, and Aggregates for maintaining consistency where it matters."
>
> **[ANIMATION: Module 4-5 nodes appear]**
>
> "The second half is where it gets powerful. CQRS—separating your reads from your writes. And Event Sourcing—capturing every change as an immutable fact."
>
> **[ANIMATION: Module 6 node appears with AI icon]**
>
> "And finally, we bring AI into the picture. You'll learn to leverage Claude, Copilot, and other AI tools to accelerate your implementation—without sacrificing design quality."
