  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the recommended workflow for AI-human collaboration in DDD development?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Let AI make all decisions" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Human understands domain, AI generates code, human reviews and refines" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Avoid using AI entirely" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Use AI only for documentation" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "The optimal workflow is: humans gather domain knowledge from experts, AI generates initial implementations, humans review for domain accuracy, AI generates tests, humans verify business rules, AI generates documentation, humans do final review and deploy."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "AI can help maintain ubiquitous language consistency by reviewing code for terminology violations.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "AI can review code against a domain glossary and identify inconsistencies like using 'Purchase' instead of 'Order', or 'Basket' instead of 'Cart'. This helps maintain ubiquitous language across the codebase."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What should be included in an AI context document for a DDD project?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Only the programming language" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Ubiquitous language, business rules, bounded contexts, and tech stack" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Just the database schema" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Only the project name" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A good AI context document includes: domain description, ubiquitous language terms, business rules, bounded contexts, tech stack, coding patterns to follow, and specific constraints (like 'use Zod for validation')."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "AI can make strategic architectural decisions for your DDD system.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "AI cannot make strategic decisions like choosing between monolith and microservices, defining aggregate boundaries, or evaluating business trade-offs. These require human judgment, stakeholder input, and understanding of organizational context."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What should a production readiness checklist for AI-generated DDD code include?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Only code formatting checks" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Domain accuracy, security, error handling, testing, observability, and documentation" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Only performance tests" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Only unit test coverage" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Production readiness requires validating: domain model accuracy, business rules match requirements, security (input validation, auth), proper error handling, comprehensive testing, observability (logging, metrics), and complete documentation."
