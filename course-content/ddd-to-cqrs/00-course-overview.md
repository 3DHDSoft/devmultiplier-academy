## Course Description

Master the journey from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) with practical AI-assisted implementation strategies. This course bridges strategic design thinking with modern architectural patterns, teaching you how to build scalable, maintainable systems that accurately model complex business domains.

Learn how AI agents can accelerate your development process while maintaining architectural integrity. By the end of this course, you'll be able to design and implement sophisticated systems using DDD principles, CQRS patterns, and Event Sourcing, all while leveraging AI tools to enhance productivity.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Understand DDD Fundamentals**
   - Identify and model core business domains
   - Apply ubiquitous language in software design
   - Recognize when DDD is appropriate for a project

2. **Apply Strategic Design**
   - Define and manage bounded contexts
   - Design context maps for complex systems
   - Implement anti-corruption layers

3. **Master Tactical Patterns**
   - Design effective aggregates and entities
   - Implement value objects and domain services
   - Apply repository and factory patterns

4. **Implement CQRS**
   - Separate read and write models
   - Design command and query handlers
   - Optimize for different access patterns

5. **Apply Event Sourcing**
   - Model business events effectively
   - Implement event stores
   - Build event-driven systems

6. **Leverage AI Assistance**
   - Use AI agents for code generation
   - Apply AI for pattern recognition
   - Integrate AI tools in your development workflow
