        { "id": "a", "text": "A diagram showing database relationships" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "A visual representation showing bounded contexts, their relationships, integration patterns, and team ownership" },

        { "id": "d", "text": "A deployment topology diagram" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A Context Map is a visual representation showing all bounded contexts in the system, relationships between contexts, integration patterns used, and team ownership."

      "question": "What is a Shared Kernel pattern?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "A shared operating system component" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Two contexts that share a subset of the domain model and code" },

        { "id": "d", "text": "A shared message queue" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Shared Kernel is when two contexts share a subset of the domain model and code. It's used when teams need to collaborate closely on stable, well-understood shared concepts."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The Shared Kernel pattern has no risks and should be used whenever possible.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Shared Kernel has significant risks: coupling between teams, changes require coordination, and it can become a bottleneck. It should only be used when teams can coordinate on changes and the shared concepts are stable."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Open Host Service is when a context exposes a well-defined protocol/API (like REST) for other contexts to consume. The Catalog context exposing a REST API for the Sales context is an example."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Anti-Corruption Layer is used when integrating with legacy systems. It creates a protective barrier between your clean domain model and the legacy system's poor or incompatible model."
