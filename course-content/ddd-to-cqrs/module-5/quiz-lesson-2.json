    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of an event store?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To cache frequently accessed data" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "To store domain events in an append-only log" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "To replace the database for read operations" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "To manage user sessions" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "An event store is a database that stores all domain events in an append-only log. Unlike traditional databases where records are updated in place, the event store only allows appending new events and reading existing ones."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Events in an event store should be named in past tense (e.g., 'OrderCreated' not 'CreateOrder').",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Events represent things that have happened, so they should be named in past tense (OrderCreated, MoneyDeposited, UserEmailChanged). Commands are in imperative form (CreateOrder), but events describe completed facts."
    },

      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is optimistic concurrency control used for in event stores?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To speed up event queries" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "To prevent concurrent modifications from causing lost updates" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "To compress event data" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "To encrypt sensitive events" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Optimistic concurrency control uses version numbers to detect concurrent modifications. If two processes try to save events for the same aggregate, the second one fails because the expected version doesn't match the current version."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What are snapshots used for in event sourcing?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To backup the event store" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "To improve performance by avoiding replay of entire event history" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "To delete old events" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "To validate event schemas" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Snapshots store the aggregate state at a specific version. Instead of replaying thousands of events, you can load the snapshot and only replay events that occurred after it, significantly improving load performance."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "When event schemas need to change, old events should be updated in place to match the new schema.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Events are immutable and should never be modified. Instead, use event versioning strategies: store a schema version number, use upcasting to transform old events when reading, or create new event types while keeping old handlers."
